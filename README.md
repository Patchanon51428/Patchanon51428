## My Projects
# First School Project <br/>
For my first project in school, we were tasked with creating a single web page that included a frontend (HTML and CSS), a backend (JavaScript), and a database (MongoDB). The website had to serve a practical purpose while implementing complete CRUD operations using REST APIs.


### Game Development Project <br/>
As a group of three, we developed a Java-based game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. We designed and documented UML diagrams for every class. The game's user interface was created with JavaFX, and we added animations using Java GUI components. Finally, we packaged the project into a JAR file for deployment.

### Software Engineering Project <br/>
In a team of nine members, we worked on a hotel reservation website as part of a software engineering project. The project spanned two sprints, each lasting two weeks, and involved all phases of software development.
In the first sprint, we added features such as hotel ratings and user comment sections.
In the second sprint, we implemented payment functionality, including PromPay QR, credit cards, and debit cards.
We managed tasks using man-hour estimates and story points. At the end of the project, we created test cases using Jest for unit testing and Cypress for end-to-end testing. We containerized the application with Docker and deployed it on Vercel.

### Embedded System Project <br/>
In a group of four, we developed an embedded system project focused on building a machine with two sensor nodes and two gateway platforms. The microcontroller controlled the sensors and sent logs to a Firebase database.
Additionally, we built a single-page mobile-friendly website for remotely controlling the machine. The microcontroller programming was done in C for an Arduino motherboard, while the mobile app was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

     
### Data Science and Data Engineering Project <br/>
In our latest project, a team of five implemented AI/ML techniques for literature data. The goal was to build a search engine using Streamlit to find matching or related literature.
We started with raw data provided by a professor and collected additional data using Beautiful Soup and APIs.
The data was cleaned and prepared using pandas.
Finally, we integrated a pre-trained search engine model from GitHub and visualized the results through Streamlit.
