## My Projects ðŸ“š
#### First School Project <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my first project in school, I were tasked with creating a single web page that included a frontend (HTML and CSS), a backend (JavaScript), and a database (MongoDB). <br/>
The website had to serve a practical purpose while implementing complete CRUD operations using REST APIs. <br/>

#### Game Development Project <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a group of three, I developed a Java-based game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. We designed and documented UML diagrams for every class. <br/>
The game's user interface was created with JavaFX, and I added animations using Java GUI components. Finally, I packaged the project into a JAR file for deployment. <br/>

#### Software Engineering Project <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a team of nine members, I worked on a hotel reservation website as part of a software engineering project. <br/>
The project spanned two sprints, each lasting two weeks, and involved all phases of software development.<br/>
In the first sprint, I added features such as hotel ratings and user comment sections.
In the second sprint, we implemented payment functionality, including PromPay QR, credit cards, and debit cards.<br/>
We managed tasks using man-hour estimates and story points. At the end of the project, I created test cases using Jest for unit testing and Cypress for end-to-end testing.<br/>
I containerized the application with Docker and deployed it on Vercel. <br/>

#### Embedded System Project <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a group of four, I developed an embedded system project focused on building a machine with two sensor nodes and two gateway platforms. <br/>
The microcontroller controlled the sensors and sent logs to a Firebase database.<br/>
Additionally, I built a single-page mobile-friendly website for remotely controlling the machine. <br/>
The microcontroller programming was done in C for an Arduino motherboard, while the mobile app was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br/>

##### Data Science and Data Engineering Project <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our latest project, a team of five implemented AI/ML techniques for literature data. The goal was to build a search engine using Streamlit to find matching or related literature.
I started with raw data provided by a professor and collected additional data using Beautiful Soup and APIs.
The data was cleaned and prepared using pandas.<br/>
Finally, I integrated a pre-trained search engine model from GitHub and visualized the results through Streamlit. <br/>
